24/05/2020 - Unable to flash this device using tuya convert, "Device did not appear with the intermediate firmware". Probably related to this issue:
https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert/issues/483

Someone more experienced with this might be able to confirm, but for noobs like me, be forwarned.
